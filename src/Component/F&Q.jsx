      question: "How does the micro-job marketplace work?",

    {
      question: "What fees does the platform charge?",
      answer: "We charge a small service fee (typically 10-15%) on completed jobs. This helps us maintain the platform, provide customer support, and ensure secure transactions for all users."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I ensure quality work from freelancers?",

    },
    {
      question: "Can I hire the same freelancer for multiple jobs?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Many clients build long-term relationships with trusted freelancers. You can save favorite freelancers to your list and easily hire them again for future projects."
